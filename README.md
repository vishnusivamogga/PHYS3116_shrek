PHYS3116 Computational Assignment - Accreted Milky way Globular Clusters
In this assignment, we aim to use the Harris, VandenBerg and Krause Catalogues of Milky Way globular clusters to extract data about the dynamics and stellar populations to see if it is possible to identify accreted GC's with their characteristic metallicities and ages. In the second part, we will identify if there are any clusters that stand out in the age-metallicity relation or that do not rotate with the bulk of any other GC's. We will conclude that two unique populations of Globular Custers exist in the Milky Way, and they stand out both dynamically, spatially and on the age-metallicity plane. 

Using this quantitative information we will aim to determine the ramifications of these accretion events in the formation process of the Milky Way, and quantify the number of GC's that may have formed within the Milky Way. As a conclusion, we will outline the following tests, which could be used to identify the possible GC formation scenarios within the Milky Way, leading to the result that Milky Way formation is hierarchical in nature, with most of the GC's being accreted from Dwarf galaxies which had very different evolutionary tracks to the Milky Way. Further tests will be needed to consolidate this resut. 

1. we performed a dynamical cut off in engergy-angular momentum using Galpy's orbits catalogue and produced an initial list of accreted candidates

2. Then filtered dynamical candidates through Vandenberg and Krause catalogue and produce an age metalicity plot. Additionally there was orbital properties also overlayed from the dynamical plots validating the accreted as two distict populations

3. Further anomalies were found such as Pal 12 as it was on the accreted curve, and also refined the dynamical plots by adding GC's within 15kpc galactocentric radius. 

4. A HB morphology was also introduced as a variable and is potentially an additional diagnostic to distinguise accreted clusters
