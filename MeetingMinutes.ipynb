    "Vish generated plots for Energy and Angular momentum using data Galpy. After Energy and Angular momentum was plotted, an initial cut by figuring that the retrograde GCs and higher energies are more likely to be accreted GCs. This cut revealed around 42 GCs excluding some clear outliers which is our initial estimate for the accreted GCs \n",
